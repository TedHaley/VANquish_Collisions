# Urban Analytics

Team members: Ted Haley, Austin Kwong, William Lu

## Description:

Urban Analytics is a analytics web-app that is designed to be used by urban planners, engineers, and decision makers. The app utilizes the City of Vancouver's existing infrastructure data and collision injury data to identify the most vulnerable road users by location, and suggest investigating solutions to increase the safety for those road users.

In addition to the web-app, we have also produced an android application that is intended to be used as a reporting system for road users who feel unsafe, or that the infrastructure can be improved, by location.

## How it works:

The web app is run locally. It connects to various datasets, web APIs, and machine learning algorithms to produce the provided solutions.

The web app is intended to run in conjunction with the android reporting app. Improvement suggestions are then integrated into their own layer on the web-app, in real-time (this has not been implemented yet).
